# 3D Rendering Project
I've attempted to create a 3D render engine using java - I followed instructions to achieve this project as linked [here](http://blog.rogach.org/2015/08/how-to-create-your-own-simple-3d-render.html).

Here's an update - even though I followed instructions, this project fascinated me in that it showed me how matrices is integrated into programming. In this case it determines the angle at which the shape is shown to the user. The sliders change the values of these matrices which in-turn rotate the shape on screen.
